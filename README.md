# Obsidian Engine

> **Born of fire, shaped by reflection.**  
> A pure Vulkan engine with an embedded Scheme runtime and a live, self-editing world.

### 🌋 Overview

**Obsidian** is a game engine written in **C**, forged atop **Vulkan**, and enlivened by an embedded **Scheme** interpreter.  
It unites the precision of low-level graphics with the expressive power of Lisp — a living system where games can be *examined, rewritten, and extended* while running.

When magma erupts from a volcano and cools in an instant, it becomes **obsidian** — dark, smooth, and reflective.  
In the same way, **Vulkan** provides the molten foundation, while **Scheme** cools and shapes it into clarity and form.  
The result is an environment where **creation and introspection are one continuous act**.

### ⚙️ Core Features

- **Vulkan renderer in pure C** — explicit, minimal, and fast  
- **Embedded Scheme REPL** — modify, extend, and inspect your game live  
- **In-game editor** — your game *is* the editor; create and tweak without leaving runtime  
- **Hot reload** — assets, logic, shaders, and pipelines  
- **Philosophy:** the engine that forges itself  

If **Vulkan** is the forge, **Scheme** is the sculptor’s hand.

### 🚧 Under Construction

**Obsidian** is still cooling.  
The first shards of reflection are forming — a renderer, a REPL, a spark of self-awareness.  
Contributions, discussions, and ideas are welcome while the core takes shape.
